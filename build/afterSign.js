// Reports what the app's signature is actually bound to, and fails the build when a signing
// identity was configured but did not take effect.
//
// macOS ties granted TCC permissions (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Photos, Apple Music...) to the
// code signing requirement of the app that asked for them. Signed with a certificate, that
// requirement names the bundle id and the certificate — neither changes across rebuilds, so the
// permissions stick. Signed ad-hoc there is no certificate to name, so macOS falls back to
// `cdhash H"..."`, the hash of the build itself: every rebuild is a stranger and every permission
// dialog comes back.
//
// Ad-hoc is a legitimate outcome for anyone building without a certificate, so it is only a warning.
// It becomes an error when CSC_NAME asked for a real identity and electron-builder quietly fell back
// to ad-hoc anyway, which it does whenever it cannot find that identity in the keychain.
